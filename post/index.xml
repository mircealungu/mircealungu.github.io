      <title>Using a Performance Monitor to Illustrate the Importance of Database Indexes</title>

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;- An internal performance monitor delivers fast insight into service performance
- Database indexes are easy and powerful tools for performance enginering 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-broad-context-two-research-projects&#34;&gt;The Broad Context: Two Research Projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a story of finding and fixing a performance bug
in one research project with the help of another research project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project #1&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; In &lt;a href=&#34;http://zeeguu.org&#34;&gt;Zeeguu&lt;/a&gt; we research how we
can make learning a foreign language more fun. We created a platform
that monitors a learners interactions with foreign texts and based on
these past interactions we recommend further personalized reading and
vocabulary exercises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project #2&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/flask-dashboard/Flask-MonitoringDashboard/&#34;&gt;Flask Monitoring Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;
(hereafter abbreviatred as FMD) is an advanced internal monitor that tracks the evolution of
performance and utilization of web applications. It can
be &lt;strong&gt;deployed with one line of code&lt;/strong&gt; in Flask-based apps
and APIs.
The main developers of the FMD are Bogdan Petre and
Patrick Vogel, two of my past master students in Groningen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long tradition of &lt;em&gt;eating your own dog food&lt;/em&gt;
the FMD is used to monitor the performance evolution
of the Zeeguu API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading-session-computation-in-zeeguu&#34;&gt;Reading Session Computation in Zeeguu&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zeeguu aims to track the time spent by the learners reading
articles by monitoring their interactions with the text
in order to distill reading sessions &amp;ndash; periods of
time in which a reader is focused on reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computing reading sessions is however not easy:
  users might leave an article open while chatting with their friends on WhatsApp
  or playing Farmville on their phone; this time should not be counted as reading
  time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to predict when the user stopped paying attention requires
complicated heuristics that
are based all the actions that a user performed while interacting
with a text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure below is a screenshot from the Zeeguu web app; it
shows multiple reading sessions inferred
based on my interactions with the Zeeguu reader yesterday and today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the article titles. you see that today I read two
French articles and yesterday I read a German one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the session lengths, you see that this morning I was
not very focused: it took me multiple sessions to read
the article about the Coca Cola bottle size. It seems that I was
not very focused on this article this morning, but rather interleaved
reading with my other morning routines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=/img/db-indexes-1.png style=&#34;border: 1px solid #ccddcc; padding: 6px; margin: 36px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- ## Investigating A Performance Bottleneck --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, today I realized that there is a big problem with
displaying of information about the user sessions in
the Zeeguu web app; it is very very slow. In fact it feels
as slow as this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=/img/sloth.gif style=&#34;border: 1px solid #ccddcc; padding: 6px; margin: 36px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fmd-to-rescue-finding-the-reason-for-the-slowness&#34;&gt;FMD To Rescue: Finding The Reason for The Slowness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The functionality for computing user sessions is implemented in
an endpoint named &lt;code&gt;user_article_history&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To find out why this endpoint is so slow, it&amp;rsquo;s very convenient to use the FMD.
As mentioned before, the FMD is already deployed in the
Zeeguu API and all we need to do is to enable &lt;strong&gt;profiling&lt;/strong&gt;
from its user interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the profiler is enabled for an endpoint, for every
call to that endpoint the FMD samples continuously the Python
call stack such that it can present information about the
lines of code where the most time was being spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thus enable the profiler for &lt;code&gt;user_article_history&lt;/code&gt;, make sure to call
the endpoint one more time, then open the Profiler tab in FMD to discover
the information presented in the figure below. The figure shows the time
spent on the corresponding lines of code called from the endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=/img/db-indexes-2.png style=&#34;border: 1px solid #ccddcc; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 20; width: 100%; &#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first line shows us that the endpoint was computing stuff for 43 seconds!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last line shows that 98% of the time is spent
in the following code line (which is not fully visible in the image):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cls.query.filter(UserActivityData.time &amp;lt; self.last_action_time).all()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is Python code that uses SQLAlchemy.
SQLAlchemy is  a very powerful ORM which will convert this Python code to SQL and
send the corresponding queries to a database management system (in our case MySQL).
In theory we do not need to know MySQL if we use SQLAlchemy. In practice,
because of something that Joel Spolsky calls &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/&#34;&gt;the law of
leaky abstractions&lt;/a&gt;,
most of the times we still need to understand some details about MySQL anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we now know that the slowness of our endpoint is probably due to the SQL query
that is generated by the SQLAlchemy code in the above-mentioned
line. And we also know that, due to the SQLAlchemy naming conventions,
the very slow SQL query must work with the &lt;code&gt;user_activity_data&lt;/code&gt; table
and its &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; column (this is given away by the &lt;code&gt;UserActivityData.time&lt;/code&gt; part in the
code above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the table structure
in the database and at the session computation algorithm we
observe two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the table has not been designed with the session computation
algorithm in mind, and the algorithm iterates many times through
all the table rows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;code&gt;user_activity_data&lt;/code&gt; table is a very large table with
hundreds of thousands of records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;database-indexes-to-rescue-fixing-the-slowness&#34;&gt;Database Indexes to Rescue: Fixing the Slowness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that comes to my mind is a recent discussion with
my sister about DB indexes and how they are very powerful performance tools. So I&amp;rsquo;m thinking, maybe
this is an opportunity to show with a case study the
impact of an index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thus go to the database and I add a new index that is
inspired by the &lt;code&gt;UserActivityData.time&lt;/code&gt; that appears
in the very slow code line above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE INDEX ... ON user_activity_data(time)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will make MySQL create additional internal structures
that will allow it to optimize queries that involve
in their condition the &lt;code&gt;user_activity_data&lt;/code&gt;
table and the &lt;code&gt;time&lt;/code&gt; column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I redeploy the API, request again the endpoint
and then I visit again the Profiler page, and lo and behold!
Instead of 43 seconds now my endpoint takes 1.6 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=/img/db-indexes-3.png style=&#34;border: 1px solid #ccddcc; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 20; width: 100%; &#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now have a nice example to show to my sister about
the huge impact indexes have on database performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-conclusion&#34;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the Beginner:&lt;/strong&gt; Indexes are very important for
the performance of your database. Also, profiling
the performance of your code is a skill you will have
to learn. The FMD is a good starting point if you
are a Flask developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the Intermediate:&lt;/strong&gt; An internal monitor for your
API can be a wonderful and much faster way of getting
insight into the workings of your service. Sure, you
can also deploy a profiler from your development
environment, but having the profiler available to be
deployed in production with a single click has the
huge advantage of you getting information about the
&lt;strong&gt;real&lt;/strong&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the Flask/Python Developer:&lt;/strong&gt; FMD can be deployed
with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/flask-dashboard/Flask-MonitoringDashboard/&#34;&gt;one line of Python code&lt;/a&gt;. And being
a research project, is also free. So try it out.
In exchange we might ask you for feedback at some point.
But hey, that&amp;rsquo;s nothing for the easy obtained valuable insights you get with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am glad to announce that I have started as Associate Professor at the IT University in Copenhagen.
I will be teaching Software Architecture, Technical Interaction Desgin, and Advanced Software Engineering. I will also be continuing my work on software evolution, software ecosystems, and using technology to enhance personalized learning. The building looks amazing. The colleagues are diverse and telented. And the city is as bike-friendly as Groningen was. I have a feeling that is &amp;ldquo;the beginning of a beautiful friendship&amp;rdquo; :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Invited Talk at the SEN Symposium</title>
      <link>https://mircealungu.github.io/post/17-01-20--sen-symposium-talk/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2017 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mircealungu.github.io/post/17-01-20--sen-symposium-talk/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The SEN symposium in Amsterdam is a yearly event that gathers software engineering researchers and practitioners. This year I was invited to give a talk along several great speakers including: Felienne Hermans, Andreas Zeller, Marielle Stoelinga, and Hans Wanders the CIO (!) of the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=/img/context-slide.png style=&#34;box-shadow:none;  width:300px; padding: 10px; padding-top:0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; border-width: 1;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my talk observing that Google, Facebook, and Twitter
are using context in order to provide us with the best&amp;hellip; ads!
I then argued that in software analytics we can use context in
order to create more powerful tools and analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular I discussed three types of context that I have experienced
with in my work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Temporal&lt;/strong&gt; context allows us to replay the evolution
of the system to better understand it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The (eco)Systemic&lt;/strong&gt; context allows us to understand a system in the
broader context in which it interacts with other systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Personal&lt;/strong&gt; context allows our analytics tools to become &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;intimate
supplements of the human mind&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; (Vannevar Bush)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div  style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;a-fun-audience&#34;&gt;A Fun Audience&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organizers have provided the participants with voting cards: yellow and
red. This is a nice idea, since you can interact with the audience in a more
interactive manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point, I took a picture of the audiencve after I asked them to lift their red cards if they
prefer to read War and Peace and the yellow cards if they&amp;rsquo;d prefer to read
the source code of ArgoUML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=/img/audience-voting.jpg style=&#34;box-shadow:none; height:300px; padding: 10px; padding-top:0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; border-width: 1px;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the three yellow cards, it seems
that in the audience there were three people who have already read War and Peace :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div  style=&#34;clear:both;&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mircealungu.github.io/pdf/SEN-Symposium--TalkSlides.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;slides of my talk are online&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>📝 Analysis Bots</title>
      <link>https://mircealungu.github.io/post/17-01-19-analysis-bots/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2017 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-story&#34;&gt;The Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our paper on analysis bots has been accepted to the ICSE ERA
track. The paper is co-written with Ivan Bestchastnick from
University of British Columbia and Yanyan Zhuang from the
University of Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is written from the perspective of software engineering
researchers and for a software engineering audience. It argues
that we must implement a platform where analysis bots compete
to provide the most meaningful analysis results to practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I think there is a more powerful and general
perspective which is trying to emerge from the paper. In particular
I find it fascinating to think of the introduction of automated
agents in a workflow which is designed for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe this is simply automation catching up with us, software engineers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-paper&#34;&gt;The Paper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://mircealungu.github.io/papers/17-analysis-bots.pdf&#34;&gt;preprint (pdf)&lt;/a&gt; is available
online. It&amp;rsquo;s not too long and an easy read ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-bibtex&#34;&gt;The BibTex&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-abstract&#34;&gt;The Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;An important part of software engineering (SE) research is to develop new analysis techniques and to integrate these techniques into software development practice. However, since access to developers is non-trivial and research tool adoption is slow, new analyses are typically evaluated as follows: a prototype tool that embeds the analysis is implemented, a set of projects is identified, their revisions are selected, and the tool is run in a controlled environment, rarely involving the developers of the software. As a result, research artifacts are brittle and it is unclear if an analysis tool would actually be adopted.

In this paper, we envision harnessing the rich interfaces provided by popular social coding platforms for automated deployment and evaluation of SE research analysis. We propose that SE analyses can be deployed as analysis bots. We focus on two specific benefits of such an approach: 
    (1) analysis bots can help evaluate analysis techniques in a less controlled, and more realistic context, and 
    (2) analysis bots provide an interface for developers to “subscribe” to new research techniques without needing to trust the implementation, the developer of the new tool, or to install the analysis tool locally. 

We outline basic requirements for an analysis bots platform, and present research challenges that would need to be resolved for bots to flourish
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <guid>https://mircealungu.github.io/post/16-11-20-teacher-of-the-year/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been nominated for the teacher of the year award!
Especially after seeing all the other nominations I started
feeling like I don&amp;rsquo;t deserve the honor. However, it is also
true that together with my team, we put a lot of effort in
  coming up with cool project ideas and
  running them
in the timespan of five months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, many thanks and congratulations for my teaching assistants:
Laura Baakman,
Jeroen Brandsma,
Georgios Digkas,
Sybren Gjaltema,
Jelle van Wezel,
Angelo Karountzos,
Alexander Lukjanenkovs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been long due to write up the lessons learned during
the most recent software engineering courses.
Now I feel the duty to do it even more.
Hopefully before I start the next batch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now for the impossible challenge: can you spot me in the picture?

      <link>https://mircealungu.github.io/post/16-11-20-polite-smalltalk-at-nool/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The programming languages reseachers have a healthy sense of humor. The -1th edition of the NOOL (New Object Oriented Languages) Workshop had a very creative call for papers. To keep up with the state of affairs, Jan Kurs and I submitted a paper with a most concise abstract:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaProgrammersUseCamelCaseToSeparateWordsInIdentifiers. &lt;br/&gt;
   Pythonistas_and_others_use_underscore_in_their_identifiers. &lt;br/&gt;
   Polite programmers can use spaces if they like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper presents briefly some of the design decisions that went into Polite, our evolutionary mutation of Smalltalk that brings the language
closer to natural language. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mircealungu/Polite_Programmers__NOOL16/blob/master/preprint.pdf&#34;&gt;preprint is online&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further Work on Polite Smalltalk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To try out Polite Smalltalk, &lt;a href=&#34;https://zenodo.org/record/61578#.WDYtDKIrKXQ&#34;&gt;Download the latest release from Zenodo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.rug.nl/~kbunte/&#34;&gt;Kerstin Bunte&lt;/a&gt;,
we are starting our new course on Introduction to Data Science.
This will be interesting:
we have 60 first year master students from
  computer science,
  astronomy, and
  mathematics.
What do they have
in common? What topics can we cover such that most of them can
benefit? Which topics are not too easy nor too challenging? We&amp;rsquo;ll see!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-story&#34;&gt;The Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a paper for the Ecosystem Architectures event (WEA&amp;rsquo;16) about the design of an ecosystem of applications which monitor a learner&amp;rsquo;s interactions with knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;An unconventional idea for an ecosystem, which shows well that there are many more opportunities to benefit from the ecosystem idea, than the various industrial applications. The concrete examples of the platform and the applications make the ideas tangible and well understandable. I particularly like the discussions of the lessons learned [&amp;hellip;]&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a very nice review to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other reviews were also positive so the paper was accepted for presentation at WEA (Workshop on Ecosystem Architectures) that will take place in Copenhagen and is colocated with ECSA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-paper&#34;&gt;The Paper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper talks about some of the challenges and
opportunities that come with bootstrapping a
ubiquitous monitoring ecosystem. It is a case
study inspired from our &lt;a href=&#34;https://zeeguu.unibe.ch&#34;&gt;Zeeguu&lt;/a&gt; ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mircealungu/Bootstrapping_an_Ecosystem__WEA16/blob/master/preprint.pdf&#34;&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Our work on Softwarenaut has finally been published in the Science
of Computer Programming. The paper
(&lt;a href=&#34;http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Lung14a.pdf&#34;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://scg.unibe.ch/scgbib?query=lung14a&amp;amp;display=bibtex&#34;&gt;bibtex&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.nl/scholar?cites=16074008290934254937&amp;amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;amp;hl=en&#34;&gt;citations&lt;/a&gt;)
introduces Softwarenaut, a visual, interactive architecture recovery tool which
leverages evolutionary analysis to support source code understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This page contains a very high level description of the tool.
For details and case studies, see&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the journal article that describes the tool (&lt;a href=&#34;http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Lung14a.pdf&#34;&gt;preprint pdf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://scg.unibe.ch/scgbib?_k=mhZxW1Pf&amp;amp;query=Lung14a&amp;amp;display=bibtex&#34;&gt;bibtex&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the conference paper that describes the way we visualized hierarchical clusterings of software systems (&lt;a href=&#34;http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Lung05aExploreSemanticClusters.pdf&#34;&gt;preprint pdf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://scg.unibe.ch/scgbib?_k=v0zYApEK&amp;amp;query=Lung05a&amp;amp;display=bibtex&#34;&gt;bibtex&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;aggregating-low-level-relations-along-a-hierarchical-decomposition-of-a-system&#34;&gt;Aggregating low-level relations along a hierarchical decomposition of a system&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Softwarenaut aggregates low-level relations along a hierarcical decomposition of a system (e.g. the package structure in Java). Softwarenaut can thus present a high-level overview of the architectural relationships between the modules in a system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure presents the architecture of Softwarenaut visualized in Softwarenaut. The module sizes are proportional to their LOC and the relationships are proportional to the number of low-level relationships abstracted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/464519/21022444/eb463a12-bd7c-11e6-9a37-f6925f371eff.png&#34; alt=&#34;architecture-of-softwarenaut&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;augmenting-the-big-picture-with-evolutionary-information&#34;&gt;Augmenting The Big Picture With Evolutionary Information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following view presents Softwarenaut visualizing itself but this time, augmenting the structure with evolutionary information. On top of the architectural view we have highlighted the classes that have the most activity in the recent evolution of the system (as of February 2011). One can see that it is a minority of classes that have been changing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/464519/21022349/9ec2f748-bd7c-11e6-87ad-29c5332caba9.png&#34; alt=&#34;evolution screenshot&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- ### Details About Relationship Evolution

The following figure presents the evolution filmstrip for the relationship between the uml and kernel modules in ArgoUML between 2003 and 2007. Inheritance relationships are represented with red and invocation relationships are represented with black. One can see that in 2004 a reverse dependency was introduced between kernel and uml and it remained in the system until its latest analyzed version

![screen-shot-2011-10-10-at-5 27 36-pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/464519/21023545/4c41a97e-bd81-11e6-81b1-fb038bd3b156.png)
 --&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;details-about-module-evolution&#34;&gt;Details About Module Evolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are mahy module detail views which present information about a particular module. The Module Evolution presents a compressed version of the module history. The module is represented in every analyzed version as a treemap. When a new class is introduced it is marked with yellow. When a class changes it is colored with a shade of blue which is darker for larger changes. The figure presents the history of the cognitive package in ArgoUML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/464519/21023626/9cffc058-bd81-11e6-906f-4f62c440717a.png&#34; alt=&#34;screen-shot-2011-10-14-at-1 56 14-am&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;coping-with-the-explosion-of-information-through-filtering&#34;&gt;Coping with the explosion of information through filtering&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Filters help coping with the explosion of information during exploration. There are two types of filters: entity filters and relationship filters. The Filters Panel allows the user to add and remove various filters during exploration. The filters panel appears instead of the Detail Panel when no entity is selected in the Architectural View.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two categories of &lt;strong&gt;entity filters&lt;/strong&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size Related: Filters all the modules that are under a certain threshold (Small Modules) or above a certain threshold (Large modules).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evolution Related:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two categories of &lt;strong&gt;relationship filters&lt;/strong&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dependency Strength: they filters the relationships based on the number of low-level explicit relationships that are abstracted in the visible relationships (e.g. Weak dependencies, Strong dependencies). These are useful when starting the analysis of systems that have a large number of modules and dependencies between them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evolutionary: they filter relationships based on the evolution of the relationships during the lifetime of the system. Examples are: lifetime, newborn, old, new. They are available only when multiple versions of a system are loaded. They are useful for either limiting the amount of information at the first encounter with a system (e.g. lifetime) or trying to find problems (e.g. newborn combined with bidirectional).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-screencast-of-softwarenaut-in-action&#34;&gt;A Screencast of Softwarenaut in Action&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2012 I prepared a screencast of the way the
tool looked at the time. I think screencasts are very important
for research tools since they may give ideas to new toolmakers
long after they tool does not compile anymore :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>📝 Mapping the Open Information Economy</title>
      <link>https://mircealungu.github.io/post/13-09-01-visualizing-stack-overflow/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mircealungu.github.io/img/stackoverflow.png&#34; alt=&#34;visualizing-stack-overflow&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;ldquo;A nobel prize is waiting for the one who visualizes the economy
of information&amp;rdquo;&lt;/b&gt; (Steward Brand, The Media Lab)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my current travelling companions is “The Media Lab – Inventing the Future at MIT” by Steward Brand. Like several other books about the history of computing in the 80s, this one is also fascinating and it shows again how much ahead of their time were people in those years… and how we are still reaping the ideas that they saw. The book reports on an anecdote by Harlan Cleveland :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have wanted for some time to find a map of information flows around the world. The other day I had one hour to kill between appointments in new york city, so I dropped into the Rand-McNally shop to ask for such a map. My request created quite a stir, and virtually every employee was called into consultation. They brought out all sorts of maps showing flows of food and feedgrains, oil and coal, weapons and manufacturers – but finally admitted that they had no map of information flows and didn’t think their competitors had one either.” (Steward Brand, Inventing the Future at MIT, pp. 245)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;can-we-make-a-map-of-information-flow-in-the-world-today&#34;&gt;Can we make a map of information flow in the world today?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes we can! In the article that we will present at SSE in Saint Petersburg this summer we show how can we do it for software engineering based on StackOverflow data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;StackOverflow is the principal website for software engineers in search for answers to programming questions. The quality of the answers and the fact that the mean time to a question being answered is 11 minutes make it the &lt;em&gt;de facto market for information&lt;/em&gt; regarding programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the StackOverflow information market the currency is &lt;em&gt;reputation points&lt;/em&gt;. The reputation points are offered by the user originating a question to the one that best answers it. Others who found the answer useful can provide further points by upvoting the answer later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As data source for our map we use ten million questions and answers (published as a database dump by A. Bacchelli at U. Lugano). Among other things the data source contains also geolocation information for a large percentage of the the users. Thus, if we aggregate the exchanges of information to geographical regions we will obtain a map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-visualize-the-map&#34;&gt;How to &lt;em&gt;visualize&lt;/em&gt; the map?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired from our earlier work on
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://mircealungu.github.io/post/14-01-01-evolutionary-and-collaborative-software-architecture-recovery/&#34;&gt;visualizing software&lt;/a&gt;
we used the following conventions for visualizing our information map:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The areas of countries and continents is proportional to the reputation of their users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thickness of an arrow indicating information flow (answers) between regions is proportional to the number of answers abstracted in it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where we had sufficient space, we labelled countries with their corresponding flags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This map of software engineering information flow in the paper looks like the figure below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;margin: 0 -48%; padding: 0 -48%;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://mircealungu.github.io/img/stackoverflow-full.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-can-we-learn&#34;&gt;What can we learn?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most straightforward observations based on this map are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EU is exporting more answers to the US than the other way around!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, US has more reputation than EU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several small countries like Switzerland or Netherland have disproportionately high reputation with respect to their population&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China is practically absent even if Joel Spolsky (the founder of SO) &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/04/stack-overflow-around-the-world/&#34;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; large numbers of visitors to the site from there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Africa does not contribute much&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-next&#34;&gt;What next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The map is taken from our paper (&lt;a href=&#34;http://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Sche13a-GeolocatingStackOverflow.pdf&#34;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://scg.unibe.ch/scgbib?_k=dvvBNH0e&amp;amp;query=Sche13a&amp;amp;display=bibtex&#34;&gt;Bibtex&lt;/a&gt;) which contains more details about the data collection and analysis (including details on geo-locating users, and the evolution over time of the data).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the map representative of the way programming information is spread around the world? Are there other similar maps that you are aware of?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to talk more about this topic &lt;a href=&#34;https://mircealungu.github.io/#contact&#34;&gt; let me know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;possible-student-project&#34;&gt;Possible Student Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few very nice ways in which this work could be continued. A student interested in working on this topic for a thesis should &lt;a href=&#34;https://mircealungu.github.io/#contact&#34;&gt; contact me&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was invited to give a keynote at Smalltalks in Argentina. Before the conference I spent some time with students at the University of Buenos Aires with Gabriela Arevallo and the other organizers of the conference. The conference was great. The argentinian Smalltalk community is extremely welcoming and passionate. I look forward to going back one day.&lt;/p&gt;
