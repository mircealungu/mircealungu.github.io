<!-- I got my PhD from the University of Lugano, with Michele Lanza as advisor and my engineer degree from the Polytechnic University of TimiÅŸoara, with a thesis supervised by Radu Marinescu and Tudor Girba. I was as a visiting researcher at IBM TJ Watson Research Center in NY with Wim De Pauw. After my PhD I spent several years as a post-doctoral researcher in the Software Composition group led by Prof. Oscar Nierstrasz. In the summer of 2010 I was a visiting scientist in the lab of Crista Lopez at UC Irvine.

## About

Since 2015 I am assistant professor in the Computer Science Department of the Johann Bernoulli Institute of the Faculty of Science and Engineering of University of Groningen. I am member of the SEARCH research group and also a member of the DSSC pioneers group which focuses on using data science in interdisciplinary research projects. I am part time visiting researcher at CWI in Amsterdam. Before coming to the Netherlands I was a postdoc at the University of Bern and a PhD student at the University of Lugano, in Switzerland.

My current research interests revolve around four main directions. In  decreasing order of the amount of work I have invested in each until now, they are:

1. [Software Evolution](posts/evolution)
2. [Software Ecosystems](posts/ecosystems)
3. [Big Software Data](post/big_software_data/)
4. [Accelerating Knowledge Acquisition](posts/aka)
