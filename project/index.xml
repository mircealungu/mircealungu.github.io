      <description>Polite Smalltalk is a small evolutionary mutation of the Smalltalk programming language that aims to encourage developers to think more about their programs as prose. The main mechanism by which Polite does this is what we define here as {\em sentence case identifiers} &amp;mdash; a naming convention that allows spaces in identifier names. Unlike projection editors which can easily allow spaces in their identifiers, Polite programs are stored as text.</description>
