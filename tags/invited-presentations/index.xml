      <description>The SEN symposium in Amsterdam is a yearly event that gathers software engineering researchers and practitioners. This year I was invited to give a talk along several great speakers including: Felienne Hermans, Andreas Zeller, Marielle Stoelinga, and Hans Wanders the CIO (!) of the Netherlands.

I started my talk observing that Google, Facebook, and Twitter are using context in order to provide us with the best&amp;hellip; ads! I then argued that in software analytics we can use context in order to create more powerful tools and analyses.</description>

      <description>I was invited to give a keynote at Smalltalks in Argentina. Before the conference I spent some time with students at the University of Buenos Aires with Gabriela Arevallo and the other organizers of the conference. The conference was great. The argentinian Smalltalk community is extremely welcoming and passionate. I look forward to going back one day.</description>
