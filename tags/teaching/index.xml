I will also be continuing my work on software evolution, software ecosystems, and using technology to enhance personalized learning. The building looks amazing. The colleagues are diverse and telented. And the city is as bike-friendly as Groningen was. I have a feeling that is &amp;ldquo;the beginning of a beautiful friendship&amp;rdquo; :)</description>

      <description>I have been nominated for the teacher of the year award! Especially after seeing all the other nominations I started feeling like I don&amp;rsquo;t deserve the honor. However, it is also true that together with my team, we put a lot of effort in coming up with cool project ideas and running them in the timespan of five months.
Thus, many thanks and congratulations for my teaching assistants: Laura Baakman, Jeroen Brandsma, Georgios Digkas, Sybren Gjaltema, Jelle van Wezel, Angelo Karountzos, Alexander Lukjanenkovs.</description>

      <description>Today, with Kerstin Bunte, we are starting our new course on Introduction to Data Science. This will be interesting: we have 60 first year master students from computer science, astronomy, and mathematics. What do they have in common? What topics can we cover such that most of them can benefit? Which topics are not too easy nor too challenging? We&amp;rsquo;ll see!</description>
