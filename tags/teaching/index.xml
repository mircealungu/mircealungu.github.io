      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been nominated for the teacher of the year award!
I consider this an honor that I do not deserve personally,
especially seeing all the other nominations. However, it is also
true that together with my team, we put a lot of effort in
  coming up with cool project ideas and
  running them
in the timespan of five months.
The (vast majority of the) students reported enjoying team work on real projects and
learning a lot in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, many thanks and congratulations for my teaching assistants:
Laura Baakman,
Jeroen Brandsma,
Georgios Digkas,
Sybren Gjaltema,
Jelle van Wezel,
Angelo Karountzos,
Alexander Lukjanenkovs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been long due to write up the lessons learned during
the most recent software engineering courses.
Now I feel the duty to do it even more.
Hopefully before I start the next batch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now for the impossible challenge: can you spot me in the picture?

      <title>Introduction to Data Science Course - Kick Off</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we are starting our new course on Introduction to Data
Science with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.rug.nl/~kbunte/&#34;&gt;Kerstin Bunte&lt;/a&gt;.
This is going to be a very interesting challenge since we have
60 first year master students from multiple disciplines:
computer science, astronomy, and mathematics. What do they have
in common? What can we talk about that they can all benefit from
while not being too easy nor too challenging? We&amp;rsquo;ll see!&lt;/p&gt;
