      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been nominated for the teacher of the year award!
Especially after seeing all the other nominations I started
feeling like I don&amp;rsquo;t deserve the honor. However, it is also
true that together with my team, we put a lot of effort in
  coming up with cool project ideas and
  running them
in the timespan of five months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, many thanks and congratulations for my teaching assistants:
Laura Baakman,
Jeroen Brandsma,
Georgios Digkas,
Sybren Gjaltema,
Jelle van Wezel,
Angelo Karountzos,
Alexander Lukjanenkovs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been long due to write up the lessons learned during
the most recent software engineering courses.
Now I feel the duty to do it even more.
Hopefully before I start the next batch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now for the impossible challenge: can you spot me in the picture?

      <title>New Course: Introduction to Data Science</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.rug.nl/~kbunte/&#34;&gt;Kerstin Bunte&lt;/a&gt;,
we are starting our new course on Introduction to Data Science.
This will be interesting:
we have 60 first year master students from
  computer science,
  astronomy, and
  mathematics.
What do they have
in common? What topics can we cover such that most of them can
benefit? Which topics are not too easy nor too challenging? We&amp;rsquo;ll see!&lt;/p&gt;
