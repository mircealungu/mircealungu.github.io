      <description>TL;DR;
- Database indexes are easy and powerful tools for performance enginering - An internal performance monitor enables quick insights into service performance  &amp;nbsp;
Prologue: Two Research Projects Project #1 - In Zeeguu we research how we can make learning a foreign language more fun. We monitor a learners interactions with foreign texts and based on this we recommend further personalized reading and personalized vocabulary exercises.
The Zeeguu web application has a classical client-server architecture with the backend being implemented with Flask &amp;ndash; one of the most popular web application frameworks for Python.</description>

      <description>I have been nominated for the teacher of the year award! Especially after seeing all the other nominations I started feeling like I don&amp;rsquo;t deserve the honor. However, it is also true that together with my team, we put a lot of effort in coming up with cool project ideas and running them in the timespan of five months.
Thus, many thanks and congratulations for my teaching assistants: Laura Baakman, Jeroen Brandsma, Georgios Digkas, Sybren Gjaltema, Jelle van Wezel, Angelo Karountzos, Alexander Lukjanenkovs.</description>

      <description>Today, with Kerstin Bunte, we are starting our new course on Introduction to Data Science. This will be interesting: we have 60 first year master students from computer science, astronomy, and mathematics. What do they have in common? What topics can we cover such that most of them can benefit? Which topics are not too easy nor too challenging? We&amp;rsquo;ll see!</description>
